# Double Entry Validation Tool

### Background
The purpose of this project is to create a tool which, given Qualtrics survey exports, can compare different survey records and efficiently identify mismatched points. This is useful for "double entry" purposes where if the survey administrator decides to enter some data on Qualtrics twice for error checking purposes, the administrator can identify whether or not all points of data in one record correspond to all point in the other record. This is useful for identifying user input error.

### Features
Takes in a .tsv Qualtrics export file, compares double-entry rows, and identifies mismatched data. 

### Additional Notes
Work in progress. Created for the Family and Culture Lab at Berkeley, CA as a side-project.
