# Double Entry Validation Tool

### Background
A tool which, given Qualtrics survey exports, can compare different survey entries (for the same participant data) and efficiently identify mismatched points. This is useful for "double entry" purposes where if the survey administrator decides to enter some data on Qualtrics twice for error checking purposes, the administrator can identify whether or not all points of data in one record correspond to all points of data in the other record. This is useful for identifying user input error.

### Features
* Takes in a (.tsv) Qualtrics export file, compares double-entry rows, and identifies mismatched data. 
* Exports mismatched data to a (.tsv) save file.
* Basic GUI (user interface)

#### Instructions
* Download latest release for your platform. Instructions can be found in the app.

### To Do
* Documentation/Comments
* Additional File Support
* More Efficient Analysis Logic
* Improved Instructions
* Advanced Options (e.g. postfix, delimiter choice, etc.)

### Additional Notes
Work in progress. Created for the Family and Culture Lab at Berkeley, CA as a side-project.
